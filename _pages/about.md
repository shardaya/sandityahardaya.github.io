I was born in Bali, Indonesia, and moved to Jakarta to get my bachelor degree in [Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.ui.ac.id/) from the Universitas Indonesia (UI). During my undergraduate study, I co-led research at the [Laboratory of Statistics and Quality Engineering](https://quality.ie.ui.ac.id/), Department of Industrial Engineering, UI under the supervisions of [Professor Isti Surjandari](http://research.eng.ui.ac.id/researcher/isti) and [Dr. Arian Dhini](http://research.eng.ui.ac.id/researcher/arian). I then spent a little under five years as Analytics Consultant at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/consulting/analytics?lnk=flatitem) and [Deloitte Consulting](https://www2.deloitte.com/sg/en/pages/strategy-operations/solutions/analytics-and-cognitive.html) where I worked with clients across the public sectors, oil & gas, logistics, telco, retail, and financial services. Currently I'm pursuing my master degree in [Business Analytics](https://analytics.columbia.edu/) at Columbia.

My first name(s) is Ida Bagus Ngurah - which shows that I have Balinese blood, my middle name is Sanditya - which I go by, and my last name is Hardaya - which I share with my brother. Let me know when you plan to visit Bali!
